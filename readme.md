# Horizon Dashboard

Horizon Dashboard is a simple web-based digital clock UI, with features to prepare you for the day ahead. After signing in with Google, the plan is to add calendar and to-do integration with suitable services, and maybe news headlines too.

Why, you ask? I don't have a clock in my room, but I do have a TV screen and an unused Raspberry Pi. The obvious solution: build my own clock!
